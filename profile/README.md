# R&D Team Repository

Welcome to the **R&D Team Repository**! 🚀  
This space is dedicated to research, experimentation, and prototyping. The goal is to provide a collaborative environment where the team can explore new technologies, test ideas, and build proof-of-concepts before moving them into production-ready projects.

---

## 📌 Purpose
- Serve as a centralized place for R&D projects.  
- Enable fast prototyping and collaboration.  
- Document findings, results, and lessons learned.  
- Provide reusable code, tools, and reference implementations.  

---
---

## 🚦 Workflow
1. **Create a branch** for each experiment or prototype.  
   Naming convention: `feature/<project-name>` or `experiment/<topic>`.  
   
2. **Document your work** in `/docs` or inside the prototype folder.  
   - What problem are you solving?  
   - What approaches did you try?  
   - What were the results?  

3. **Code reviews** are encouraged, but not mandatory for early experiments.  

4. **Merge or archive** once the prototype is complete.  
   - If promising → merge to `main` for reference.  
   - If not → move to `/archive` with a short note on lessons learned.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
This repo may include multiple languages, frameworks, and tools depending on the experiment. Commonly used:  
- **Python** (data analysis, automation, ML)  
- **Node.js / TypeScript** (APIs, tooling)  
- **Docker / Kubernetes** (containerized experiments)  
- **Terraform** (infra prototypes)  

---

## ✅ Contribution Guidelines
- Keep experiments isolated (one folder per prototype).  
- Add a `README.md` inside your project folder explaining context and usage.  
- Follow basic code hygiene (linting, comments, docs).  
- Respect licensing and third-party code attribution.  

---

## 📖 Documentation
- See the `/docs` folder for ongoing research notes, design ideas, and technical references.  
- Each prototype should include:  
  - **Setup instructions**  
  - **Dependencies**  
  - **Usage examples**  

---

## 📌 Notes
- This repository is **not for production code**.  
- Expect breaking changes and experimental features.  
- Collaboration and curiosity are encouraged!
